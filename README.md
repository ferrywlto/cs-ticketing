# Customer Support Ticketing System

## Requirements

- [ ] Ticket Creation: Allow creation of new support tickets with subject and
description.
- [ ] Ticket List View: Display a list of unresolved support tickets with their subject, username, user ID and placeholder avatar.
- [ ] Ticket Detail View: Allow viewing the full details of a ticket, including a
chronological thread of replies.
- [ ] Reply to Ticket: Support agents should be able to add replies to a ticket.
- [ ] Status Updates:
    - [ ] A ticket starts as ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù.
    - [ ] It becomes ‚ÄúIn Resolution‚Äù when an agent replies.
    - [ ] It can be manually marked as ‚ÄúResolved‚Äù by the agent.

### Backend
- Use .Net 8 for the backend.
- Expose a RESTful API to manage tickets and replies.
- Store data using SQLite or in-memory storage.
- Apply clean code principles and design patterns (e.g., Repository, Service Layer, Dependency Injection).
- Include unit tests for core logic (status updates, reply handling, etc.).

### Frontend
- Use any modern JavaScript framework of your choice: Blazor, React, Vue, or Angular.
- Implement the UI with:
    - Ticket list
    - Ticket detail + replies thread
- Forms to reply and create new tickets
- Interact with the backend using proper API calls.
- Demonstrate effective state management

## How to run
TBD

## Requirement Analysis
- There are the entities in the system:
    1. Customer (Player) - Who file customer service ticket.
    2. Customer Service Agent (Agent) - Who handle the customer support tickets.
    3. Ticket - Initiated by a player of what happened. 
    4. Reply - Initiated by either a player or an agent.
- Each Reply contains:
    - Id - unique identifier of a reply
    - What - The message content
    - Who - A player / an agent
    - When - The time
- Each player and agent is a user that:
    - Has an Id - unique identifier
    - Has an email as user name
    - Has a name
    - Has an avatar in blob url format
    - Has password hash
    - Player has an additional field: player number
- Each ticket contains:
    - Id - unique identifier 
    - Creator - Player
    - Status - from ["Open", "In Resolution", "Resolved"], the initial status is open. When ever an agent replies the ticket status will change to in resolution if it is in open status. When an agent click resolve, and the ticket is in resolution status, it will change to resolved.
    - Title - Ticket title
    - Description - Message content
    - CreatedDate - The timestamp that the thread created.
    - LastUpdateDate - The timestamp that the thread created, the last message created in that thread or when the ticket is resolved.
    - Messages - A list of messages from both player and agents, sort by message date in ascending order.
    - ResolvedBy - The agent who resolved the ticket

## Assumptions
- Once a message is send, it cannot be edited for integrity.
- All CS Agents share the same avatar and share the same name "CS Agent".
- The list of tickets shows only "open" and "in resolution" tickets.
- The buttons of creating a new ticket and resolving a ticket is limited to player.
- When a player sign-in, they can only see their own tickets on the ticket list.
    - Player can see all tickets on ticket list, including resolved tickets, in reverse chronological order.
- When an agent sign-in, they can see all tickets that are open or in-resolution.
- There will be two sign-in pages:
    - One for player
    - One for agent
- Ticket can be handled by any agent, no assignment required.
- Assume user will refresh the page to load latest ticket status.
- Player can only see their own tickets on the list.
- Player can reply their tickets.
- Agent can see all tickets from any player on the list.
- Agent can reply to any ticket.  
- Only Player can create new ticket.

## Technical Decisions
- Using In-memory database due to keeping the project as simple as possible without external dependencies, this make sure user can run on their machine regardless of platform. As data persistency is not a mandatory in requirements.
- Using Entity Framework is not mandatory, as a clear data access layer should abstract the infrastructure and underlying implementation details. The same data access API should work with different storage provider interfaces.
- Basic username and password are used as authentication mechanism as the project is not aim for secure production use, in real world we should use more secure approach like OAuth + MFA. 
- Due to the same reason the agent or user account management is not included in this project.
- The Mapper classes was created to make our methods idempotent. We are not using AutoMapper in this project to keep the dependencies to minimum for simplicity, ensuring smooth `dotnet restore` process for code user.

## Design
- We will use .NET Aspire to orchestrate the following projects:
    - Domain Model
    - Infrastructure - EF Core, repositories, external services. 
    - Application - Orchestration of business logic and domain objects.
    - API - REST API endpoints from Web API / Minimal API.
    - Web - Blazor WASM front-end client.
    - UnitTests
    - Integration Tests
    - E2E Tests - Selenium for testing UI behavior
- It is arguably that we should have different independently deployable services for authentication user and ticket management. However for this project scale it is a bit over-engineering. Instead we will focus on separating concerns into isolated service and controller classes.
- Due to the lack of user management, user and agent records are seeded during application startup.
- We will use JWT with short exp for session management. 
- We will use Redux style dispatch and mutate pattern for frontend state management.
- We will use CDN Bootstrap styles for frontend UI styles for simplicity.
- For front-end state management, create classes:
  - AppState - An object to hold the application state, ideally in record type.
  - AppStateStore - A centralized state management store in Redux approach.
    - It holds an instance of AppState which is immutable from outside. 
    - The app state can only be modified from the private mutation methods. 
    - The store will expose public dispatch and query methods that will call the mutation methods.
    - It always return a immutable copy of the app state when query.
  - The AppStateStore is registered as a singleton in DI container, injected into pages. 

## Security Configuration

### Password Hashing
The system uses PBKDF2 with salted hashing for secure password storage:

1. **Development Setup**: Passwords are hashed using user secrets
   ```bash
   # Set the salt (minimum 32 characters)
   dotnet user-secrets set "PasswordHasher:Salt" "your-secure-salt-here" --project CustomerServiceApp.API
   
   # Set iterations (default: 100,000)
   dotnet user-secrets set "PasswordHasher:Iterations" "100000" --project CustomerServiceApp.API
   ```

2. **Production Setup**: Configure via environment variables or secure configuration, this is a simplified approach for this project. In real world application this should comes from AWS / GCP SecretManager or Azure KeyVault.

   ```json
   {
     "PasswordHasher": {
       "Salt": "REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_SALT_IN_PRODUCTION",
       "Iterations": 100000
     }
   }
   ```

**Security Features:**
- PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for password hashing
- Configurable salt for additional security
- Configurable iterations for performance/security balance
- User secrets integration for development
- No plaintext passwords stored in configuration

## Possible enhancements
- Use better authentication mechanism like OAuth and MFA.
- Use real database for persistent data storage.
- APIs for user management.
- Queuing mechanism to fetch and processing ticket requests to avoid overwhelm infrastructure.
- Separate APIs by concern into individual deployable units.
- CI/CD pipeline with test automation
- Cloud deployment
- Caching mechanism to improve frequent reading tickets loading time.  
- Using Signalr for ticket update notifications.
- Paging mechanism for loading tickets and messages in a ticket thread.
- Apply rate limit to APIs
